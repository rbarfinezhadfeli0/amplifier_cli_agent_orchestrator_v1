"""Base provider interface for CLI tool abstraction.

This module defines the abstract base class that all CLI providers must implement.
A "provider" is an adapter that enables CAO to interact with a specific CLI-based
AI agent (e.g., Kiro CLI, Claude Code, Codex, Q CLI).

Provider Responsibilities:
- Initialize the CLI tool in a tmux window (run startup commands)
- Detect terminal state by parsing terminal output (IDLE, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, etc.)
- Extract agent responses from terminal output
- Provide cleanup logic when terminal is deleted

Implemented Providers:
- KiroCliProvider: For Kiro CLI (kiro-cli chat)
- ClaudeCodeProvider: For Claude Code (claude)
- CodexProvider: For Codex CLI (codex)
- QCliProvider: For Amazon Q Developer CLI (q chat)

Each provider must implement pattern matching for its specific CLI's prompt
and output format to reliably detect status changes.
