"""Gemini CLI provider implementation.

Gemini CLI (https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) is Google's coding agent CLI tool.
It runs as an interactive TUI using Ink (React-based terminal UI) in the terminal.

Key characteristics:
- Command: ``gemini`` (installed via ``npm install -g @google/gemini-cli``)
- Idle prompt: ``*`` asterisk with placeholder text "Type your message" in bottom input box
- Processing: User query displayed in input box with ``*`` prefix and thinking text below
- Response format: Lines prefixed with ``✦`` (U+2726, four-pointed star)
- User query display: Lines prefixed with ``>`` (greater-than) inside bordered input box
- Input box borders: ``▀`` (U+2580 top border), ``▄`` (U+2584 bottom border)
- Tool call results: Bordered box using ``╭╰╮╯`` with ``✓`` checkmark
- Auto-approve: ``--yolo`` / ``-y`` flag bypasses all tool action confirmations
- MCP config: Written directly to ``~/.gemini/settings.json`` (not via ``gemini mcp add``)
- Exit commands: Ctrl+D to exit; Ctrl+C cancels current query
- Status bar: ``~/dir (branch*)  sandbox  Auto (Model) /model |XX.X MB``
- YOLO indicator: ``YOLO mode (ctrl + y to toggle)`` above bottom input box

Status Detection Strategy:
    Gemini CLI uses an Ink-based full-screen TUI (not alternate screen), so status
    is detected by checking the bottom of tmux capture output:
    - IDLE: ``*`` placeholder text ("Type your message") visible in bottom input box
    - PROCESSING: ``*`` prefix with user query text (not placeholder) in bottom input box,
      or ``Responding with`` model indicator visible without response completion
    - COMPLETED: ``✦`` response text + ``*`` idle placeholder in bottom input box
    - ERROR: Error message patterns or empty output

        Command structure:
            gemini --yolo --sandbox false [-i "system prompt"]

        The --yolo flag auto-approves all tool actions, which is required for
        non-interactive operation in CAO-managed tmux sessions.

        System prompt injection uses the ``-i`` (``--prompt-interactive``) flag,
        which sends the system prompt as the first user message and continues in
        interactive mode. This is the primary injection method because Gemini CLI
        treats ``-i`` text as a direct instruction the model strongly adopts.

        GEMINI.md is written as supplementary project context (the model sees it
        as background documentation). On its own, GEMINI.md is too weak — the
        model responds "I am an interactive CLI agent" instead of adopting the
        supervisor role. The ``-i`` flag solves this (lesson #12).
